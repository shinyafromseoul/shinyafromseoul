Hi, I'm <Youngho Shin> from South Korea. </br>
I used to work as a video editor/ Korean translator/ interpreter. </br>
But, I'm hoping to get on a data scientist/ programmer's career. </br>
In order to achieve my goal, I'm studying <Python> and <Javascript> </br>
To contact me, you can find me on "Instagram: @shinyafroseoul" </br>
  
  Until I make it, cheers!
